## use of each and every files and folders

1. .idea -> holds some config for android studio
2. android -> super important as it holds a complete android project as we could also create it without Flutter. In this folder we rarely work
3. build -> This folder is generated and managed by the Flutter.
4. ios -> same with ios as of android
5. lib -> 99% of the work will be done here.
6. test -> won't be too important , automated test will be written here.
7. analysis_options.yaml -> 
8. application_1.iml -> automatically managed by flutter sdk not for our work
9. pubspec.lock -> not a file in which we will not work
10. pubspec.yaml -> mostly used for manage the dependencies
